The profile screen is exactly as it sounds. The profile of the user that is currently logged in. Most of the information 
displayed in hard-coded, meaning that the ability to customize the page freely is extremely limited. As you will see in
screenshot, stock images have been placed to represent a feed as well as the user's profile picture.
